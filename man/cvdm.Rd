\usage{
cvdm(
  formula,
  data,
  method1 = c("OLS", "MR", "RLM", "RLM-MM"),
  method2 = c("OLS", "MR", "RLM", "RLM-MM"),
  subset,
  na.action,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula object, with the dependent variable on the
left of a ~ operator, and the independent variables on the right.}

\item{data}{A data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by
as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model.}

\item{method1}{A method to estimate the model. Currently takes
Ordinary Least Squares ("OLS"), Median Regression ("MR"), Robust Linear
Regression ("RLM") using M-estimation, and Robust Linear Regression using
MM-estimation ("RLM-MM"). The algorithm method used to compute the fit for the
median regression is the modified version of the Barrodale and Roberts algorithm
for l1-regression, which is the \code{\link[quantreg]{rq}} default by R package quantreg.
See quantreg \code{\link[quantreg]{rq}} function documentation for more details.
Fitting for the robust regressions is done by iterated re-weighted least squares
(IWLS) and is taken from the MASS package \code{\link[MASS]{rlm}} function.
The MM-estimation is the M-estimation with Tukey's biweight initialized by a specific
S-estimate. The M-estimation, which can be achieved in this package with the
option "RLM", is the default for the MASS \code{\link[MASS]{rlm}}
function. See MASS package \code{\link[MASS]{rlm}} documentation for details.}

\item{method2}{A method to estimate the model. Options
are same as for method1.}

\item{subset}{Expression indicating which subset of the rows of data should be
used in the fit. All observations are included by default.}

\item{na.action}{A missing-data filter function, applied to the model.frame,
after any subset argument has been used.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments, currently unsupported.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{cvdm} computed by the cross-validated log likelihood
difference in means test (CVDM). The object is the Cross-Validated Johnson's t-test.
A positive test statistic supports the first method and a negative test statistic supports
the second. See \code{\link{cvdm_object}} for more details.
}
\description{
Applies cross-validated log-likelihood difference in means test to
compare two methods of estimating a formula. The output identifies the more
appropriate model.

\details{
This function implements the cross-validated difference in means (CVDM)
test between two methods of estimating a formula. The function takes
a formula and two methods and computes a vector of cross-validated log-
likelihoods (CVLLs) for each method using the leave-one-out method. These
output test score is the cross-validated Johnson's t-test. A positive test
statistic supports the first method and a negative test statistic supports
the second. Singular matrices during the leave-one-out cross-validation process
are skipped.
