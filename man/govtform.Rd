\title{Data from Golder (2010) on government formation in Western Europe}
\format{
A data frame with 410 rows and 18 variables. The following are taken
from the codebook at
\doi{10.7910/DVN/BUWZBA}.
\describe{
 \item{countryname}{names of countries used in analysis}
 \item{country}{unique number identifying each country}
 \item{cabinet}{unique number identifying each country.
 Begins with country code, followed by cabinets 1 - n}
 \item{bargainingdays}{the number of days between either an election
 or the resignation of the previous government and the day on
 which the new government is officially inaugurated}
 \item{datein}{date on which a government took office. Format is YYMMDD}
 \item{dateout}{date on which a government left office. Format is YYMMDD}
 \item{postelection}{dichotomous variable that equals 1 if a government
 is the first to form after an election (more uncertainty) and 0 if it
 forms in an interelection period (less uncertainty)}
 \item{nonpartisan}{dichotomous variable that equals 1 if the government
 is nonpartisan and 0 otherwise}
 \item{legislative_parties}{a fraction representing the number of parties that
 have won legislative seats. See codebook for more detail}
 \item{inconclusive}{the number of inconclusive bargaining rounds prior to
 a new government successfully forming}
 \item{cabinetname}{cabinet name identified by surname
 of prime minister (followed by a number if the PM presided
 over more than one cabinet)}
 \item{singleparty_majority}{dichotomous variable that equals 1 if a single
 party controls a majority of the legislative seats, 0 otherwise}
 \item{polarization}{measures the level of ideological polarization in the party
 system. See codebook for more detail}
 \item{continuation}{dichotomous variable that equals 1 if the outgoing
 government or formateur gets the first opportunity to form a new
 government, 0 otherwise. See codebook for more detail}
 \item{positive_parl}{dichotomous variable that equals 1 if a new government
 requires the explicit support of a legislative majority in order to take
 office, 0 otherwise. See codebook for more detail}
 \item{post_legislative_parties}{interaction term made by multiplying the postelection
 variable with the legislative_parties variable}
 \item{post_polariz}{interaction term made by multiplying the postelection
 variable with the polarization variable}
 \item{post_positive}{interaction term made by multiplying the postelection
 variable with the positive_parl variable}
